This document is a small FAQ to the Husky-Project.
Written because the FAQ from Markus Mandalka is a little
outdated, very small and only in German. (Yes, my first
start with this was in german too, but now it is in (bad)
english :) ).

@c --- Where are the newest Failures written by me ?
@section Where to get the newest Version of this Document ?
There are many ways to get the newest Version of the FAQ.
@c -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
@subsection Using CVS
If you have access to the Husky CVS Server then you should take a
look at the huskybse-Directory.
@subsection Using the Web.
The latest and greatest Version is always available via
@uref{http://cvs.physcip.uni-stuttgart.de/cvs2, Web-CVS for Husky}. Just 
download the latest huskybse*.tar.gz
@subsection [Debian]: Using apt-get
Not yet available, but in the near future their will be a
Debian-Package with all available Doku and example Configurations for
Husky. This FAQ is included there.

@node contact, contribute, get, general
@c --- Only for good things, no bad please :)
@c --- Other Authors (if there will be one :) ) just add your
@c --- Contact Information.
@section How to contact the Author(s) ?
You can reach me via Fidonet at 2:2435/109 or in the Echo
@b{FIDOSOFT.HUSKY}.
You can send a email to @email{joerg@@goliathbbs.dnsalias.net, Joerg Jaspert}.

@node contribute, contribute2, contact, general
@c --- What ? Someone has a new Question for the FAQ ?
@section How to contribute to this FAQ ?
If you have write-access to the Husky CVS Server just use this. If
not send an email to the author(s). Look at the previous question.
.
@node contribute2, whatis, contribute, general
@c --- Uhh, someone without cvs Access wants to send a patch ?
@section How to contribute to one of the Programs in Husky ?
At the very first make sure that you are using the latest version of
the program. A patch to a 2 Year old version is not very useful. :)

After this take a look at the Team-Page available at
@uref{http://husky.physcip.uni-stuttgart.de/team.html,Husky Team} to
find the email of the developer for this program. Then use gnudiff or
something similar to create a diff-file and send this with a few
words to the developer.

If you have more than one patch or you want to do more work with some
programs you should write a email to Tobias Ernst and ask for
write-Access to the cvs-Server.

@node whatis, hardware, contribute2, general
@c --- Yes, what is husky ? :) Husky's are DOGS ! :)
@section What is the Husky-Project ?
The goal of this project is to develop a complete freeware suite of 
Fidonet applications, running under Linux and other 
multitasking/multiuser systems. The suite should be comparable to 
now existing (and partly commercial) OS/2 systems.

Most of the software is GPLed unless otherwise specified.

To keep the configuration simple and reliable, all applications 
should use one set of configuration-files. 

@node hardware, , whatis, general
@c --- Here i NEED help, cos i only have Debian on an x86 !
@section On which Systems does Husky works ?
It works on every System you could get the source compiled with gcc.
I @i{think} it will work on every system which has a gcc, but i only
have a Debian GNU/Linux on x86-Hardware.

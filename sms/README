I've installed the following tools that are needed for my setup but are not
Fido-related:

- arc
- lha
- unace
- unarj
- unzip
- zip


The whole system is running as user fido, all non-sensitive files (i.e. that
contain no passwords or netmails) are world-readable (chmod 755 / 644).
Echomail areas are group-writable (chmod 664, group fido).
No program has the setuid/setgid bit set.

The permissions of /dev/tty{I*,S*} are set to 660, owner is fido.fido.

/etc/profile contains the following section:

=== Cut ===
export FIDOCONFIG=/husky/cfg/config
export PT=/husky/cfg
export PROGATE=/husky/cfg
export PMKNL=/husky/cfg
export MSGID=/husky/work
=== Cut ===

/husky/bin is in PATH (/etc/profile), /husky/lib is in /etc/ld.so.conf

Minicom has two configs, the default one is for ISDN and uses /dev/ttyI3
at 115200 with Init string "^M~ATZ^M~AT&E6227041^M~" (6227041 is the MSN
I use for the mailbox). "ttyS1" is for the (analog) modem and uses /dev/ttyS1
at 115200 with Init string "^M~ATZ^M~". Both setups set the BS (BackSpace)
key to BS, not to DEL.

mgetty is compiled with Fido- and AutoPPP-Support and has its Cfgs in
/etc/mgetty. /usr/local/bin/ppplogin is used for AutoPPP. The devices ttyI5
ttyS1 are handled. The issue file /husky/cfg/fido_issue contains
a short greeting. On ttyI5 it listens to 6227042 for PPP callers.

BTXE is compiled with fidoconfig-support, so the additional password list is
rather short (ifcico needs it, though).

This are the entries in /etc/inittab:

=== Cut ===
S1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty -i/husky/cfg/fido_issue /dev/ttyS1
I5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty -i/husky/cfg/fido_issue /dev/ttyI5
=== Cut ===

/usr/local/bin/ppplogin uses /etc/ppp/options.ttyxx for assigning the remote
IPs

ifcico uses /husky/cfg/ifcico.cfg as config, which includes
/husky/cfg/ifcico.global.cfg and /husky/cfg/password.lst (chmod 640).

/husky/cfg/tty.lst contains a list of all devices used by the fido subsystem
and their purpose.

/husky/cfg/group.lst lists all groups used in fidoconfig.

MsgEd has an own Cfg, but also uses fidoconfig for addresses, areas, etc.

PTFLG (a filelist generator using the protick config) is a script and needs
a bit of configuration, so it had better gone to /husky/scripts.

The whole fido subsystem is started at boot time and shut down on reboot/halt
with the script /etc/init.d/fido.

/husky/bin/mvhuskylog renames the logfiles at the end of every day to
<name>.<2 digit Year><2 digit Month><2 digit day>.

There are several entries in crontab:
  - /husky/bin/mvhuskylog at 23:59
  - /bin/touch: /husky/work/{maint.now, week.now, 14day.now, month.now}
  - /husky/bin/poll: uplinks
  - /husky/bin/request: request "FILES" from several nodes every month


/husky/cfg/stages.lst contains a new concept I might use in future.


The following subdirectories and files are contained in this package:

Directory		Original dir
scripts			/husky/scripts
cfg			/husky/cfg


2:2435/434 is my IP node at the university.

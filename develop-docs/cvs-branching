About Husky Software Version Numbers and CVS Branches
=====================================================

Husky software is developed over the internet using CVS.  A large group of
programmers is simultaneously working on the code, constantly adding
features, fixing bugs, but also inadvertantly introducing new problems.  In
order to provide the best level of qualtiy to our users, while at the same
time not restricting creativity of our developers, the Husky team therefore
has decided to split it's software into two branches:  A development
branch, and a stable branch.  This text describes the consequences of this
for users and developers.

1. Users's point of view
------------------------

Each Husky project has a version number, like e.g. hpt 0.9.7.  This version
number is changed from time to time, but is not unique.  As almost every
day developers add modifications to the code, "hpt 0.9.7" can describe a
vast number of actually different code levels.  If you have a verison of a
Husky software that only advertises this version number, it is a direct
snapshot of our development source code.  Using such snapshots is oly
recommendet to experienced users like beta-testers and developers.

When we make a release, we fork off a "stable" branch from the main branch.
Software from the stable branch is release level software and advertises
this by adding "-stable" to the version number.  E.g:  "hpt 0.9.7-stable".
This version number is also the version number of the actual release.

After we have done a public release, we probably get some bug reports for
this.  In order to provide fixes for this bugs to the users without forcing
the users to use the current development version (which also contains the
fixes, but probably also new bugs etc.), it may happen that we do another
release from the stable branch with the same basic version number.  Such a
maintainance release is denoted by letters after the version number, like
for example "hpt 0.9.7a-stable".

We try hard to guarantee interoperability between the different releases
from the same stable branch.  A users who has installed the first stable
release, like e.g.  "fidoconfig 0.10-stable" and "hpt 0.9.7-stable", can
safely upgrade to any subsequent stable release from the same branch and be
sure that

- He does not have to change anything in his configuration files

- He does not have to recompile (or even update) the libraries he uses.
This means that he can upgrade "hpt 0.9.7-stable" to "hpt 0.9.7c-stable"
but leave fidoconfig untouched, or he can upgrade only fidoconfig, but
leave hpt as is.  Of course he can also upgrade both if he wants to.

- He will mostly inherit only bug fixes, but not features or other major
behaviour changes.  Even if a bug fix is so complex that we cannot make
sure to integrate it without introducing side effects, it will NOT appear
in the stable branch.

Of course, when you upgrade to a different branch, e.g. from "hpt
0.9.7c-stable" to "hpt 0.9.9a-stable", this does no longer hold true, so
that in this case you will have to update your libraries and expect all
sorts of configuration syntax and other behaviour changes.

Programmer's View
-----------------

For most developers, not much will change.  Just work and commit like you
did before.  However the following are general consequences that affect ALL
persons that are able to commit to CVS, no matter if a release is currently
pending or not:

- Check in modifications one by one.  Don't group multiple logically
  independent modifications into a single checkins.  In particular, never
  check in bug fixes together with new features.  This ensures that fixes
  can be migrated easily between the branches.

- DO provide meaningful CVS log messages. PLEASE!

The following describes the release procedure:

When a maintainer of a project wants to do a release, he creates a "stable"
branch for this version. This works like this:

- Checkout a fresh copy of the software.
- In the working directory, run "cvs tag -b TAG", where TAG is composed of
  program name and version number with underscores, like e.g. "hpt-0_9_7".
  Don't forget the "-b" argument!!!
- Remove the entire working directory.
- Go to a subdirectory where you want to store working copies of the stable
  branch (use a different one than you normal working root in order not to
  get confused) and run "cvs co -r TAG MODULENAME"
- Change the VERSION file in your project directory to include the
  "-stable" suffix in the verison number. Check in that change.
- Post a message to FIDOSOFT.HUSKY saying that you have created the branch,
  tell the others the TAG you chose, and say that you plan to do a release.

After you created the branch, all checkins that you did in the copy that
you checked out using "cvs co -r TAG MODULENAME" will ONLY go to the stable
branches, while checkins that you do in directories that have been checked
out without the "-r" directory (i.E. those of most other developers) will
ONLY go to the development branch.  So be careful that you do checkins from
the right directory.

Here are some rules for creating a -stable branch

- Do it at a point when the software is already rather stable.

- If your software uses libraries like smapi or fidoconf, you must find a
  stable version of those libraries to link your program against (creating a
  stable branch that needs to be linked against unstable libraries is not
  acceptable).  If the last stable version of the librarie is not enough to
  build your program, as the maintainers of the libraries to create a new
  stable branch for them.

ALL HUSKY DEVELOPERS should be aware of the fact when a stable branch
exists.  EVERY developer that does a bug fix after a stable branch existed
should decide if this bug fix must also be applied to the stable branch.
If so, he has two choices

1. inform the program maintainer about the fix and let him do the work of
   checking it into the stable branch
2. commit the fix directly to the stable branch

Choice 2. is only for developers who are well accustomed to using CVS and
who are well accustomed with the inner workings of the program they are
modifying.  Committing to the stable branch is not to be taken lightly -
errors that you make there are much more fatal than when you make them in
the current branch.  If you feel unsure, you'd better not do it and leave
commiting to the stable branch to the project maintainer.

Now, here are some rules that you MUST ALWAYS ABIDE TO if you commit
anything to a -stable branch:

1. Never commit new features. Only commit bug fixes.

2. If a bug fix is very complicated (i.E. contains rather rewrites of parts
   of the code), think about if it is really necessary. If you think that
   users can also live without this fix, then don't commit it.

3. IN A LIBRARY - NEVER EVER CHANGE CALLING CONVENTIONS.  Users must be
   able to use any stable software with the any version of the
   corresponding stable library.  This means that in a stable library
   branch, you MUST

   - NEVER change the parameter list of non-static functions
   - NEVER do a single change to structures that are passed on to the
     calling programs (in particular, the fidoconfig structure). This means
     that you never are able to introduce new keywords to fidoconfig once
     you are in a stable branch.
   - NEVER change linkage relevant flags in the makefiles (like pascal vs.
     C calling style, structure packing flags, etc.)

4. Once the first release from a stable branch has been made, be even more
   careful with your checkins.  Once a release has been made from the
   stable branch, maintainance releases could be made at any moment if
   necessary.  So be sure that everything you commit works from the moment
   that you check it in.

5. If in doubt, ask others.

Finally, here comes the technical info on how to migrate fixes betwee the
current and the stable branch.

Suppose a developer has informed me that he did a patch to file "scan.c" in
project hpt".  Suppose I store the current checkout of hpt in
"e:\home\husky\hpt", and the stable checkout of hpt in
"e:\home\husky\stable\hpt".

- First, look at the log file of scan.c:

  [E:\home\husky\hpt\src] cvs log scan.c

- From the log file, find out which version number corresponds to the fix
  that you want to migrate. Let's suppose it is 1.103

  [ Note:  the preceding two steps are superfluous if it was yourself who
  wrote the fix.  In this case, you will already know this version number
  from the output of the checkin command ]

- View the contents of the fix:
  [E:\home\husky\hpt\src] cvs diff -r 1.102 -r 1.103 scan.c | less

- Make double sure that this checkin ONLY contains the fix that the perosn
  mentioned, and not any other side effects.  If it does contian other
  things, you will have to manually redo his relevant changes in the stable
  directory and commit it there.  This is work.  However, if the
  differences between 1.102 and 1.103 only contain things that you want to
  migrate, you can do it as follows.  I hope you now understand why I ask
  every developer to commit fixes ONE BY ONE!

- Make double sure that the changes comply to the rules for stable checkins
  laid out above.

- Change into the stable checkout directory and apply the patch as follows:

  [E:\home\husky\stable\hpt\src]cvs update -j 1.102 -j 1.103 scan.c

  It is important that you use "-j" and NOT "-r". If you get conflicts,
  resolve them.

- Update the Changelog.

- Commit your changes:

  [E:\home\husky\stable\hpt]cvs ci

A final word:  This short introduction does not relieve you from the
necessity to read the CVS manual.  It contains a chapter called "branching
and merging", and you should have read that one before doing anything on
any Husky stable branch.

Thanks for your support!
